# mesmerize-viz
Highly interactive widgets for calcium imaging analysis visualization in jupyter notebooks. These visualizations are built using [`fastplotlib`](https://github.com/kushalkolar/fastplotlib) that can utilize [Vulkan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan), so they are faster than `mesmerize-napari`. 

Widgets built using [`fastplotlib`](https://github.com/kushalkolar/fastplotlib) and `ipywidgets` for exploring the data stored in a batch DataFrame from [mesmerize-core](https://github.com/nel-lab/mesmerize-core)

This requires [`mesmerize-core`](https://github.com/nel-lab/mesmerize-core) and [`fastplotlib`](https://github.com/kushalkolar/fastplotlib)` to be installed.

This is a WIP, currently includes experimental widget for inspecting motion correction results (see video)
