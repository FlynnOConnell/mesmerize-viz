# mesmerize-viz

This project is in very early development and this current repo is very out of date (since we had to bring up `fastplotlib` to a more mature phase of development), [`mesmerize-core`](https://github.com/nel-lab/mesmerize-core) demo notebooks contain extensive visualizations so please use those until `mesemrize-viz` is ready.
